The RCW directories names for the LS2088AQDS boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abcdefgh_ijklmn_op_qr:

a = What is available in SFP cage 1
b = What is available in SFP cage 2
c = What is available in SFP cage 3
d = What is available in SFP cage 4
e = What is available in SFP cage 5
f = What is available in SFP cage 6
g = What is available in SFP cage 7
h = What is available in SFP cage 8
i = What is available in Slot 1
j = What is available in Slot 2
k = What is available in Slot 3
l = What is available in Slot 4
m = What is available in Slot 5
n = What is available in Slot 6
o = SATA1
p = SATA2

For the Slots (c..j):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'H' is SATA

Serdes1 protocol (q):
q = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (r):
r = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

BIN   Core/Platform/DDR/DP-DDR
Bin1: 2000MHz/800MHz/2133MT/s/1600MT/s


Files naming convention
=============================
PBL_q_r_x_y_z_w.bin

s = SerDes1 Protocol
t = SerDes2 Protocol
x = Core frequency
y = Platform frequency
z = DDR frequency
w = DP-DDR frequency

For example,
	PBL_0x2a_0x41_2000_800_2133_1600.bin
