The RCW directories names for the LS2081ARDB  boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abcdefgh_ijk_lm_n_o:

a = What is available in SFP cage 1
b = What is available in SFP cage 2
c = What is available in SFP cage 3
d = What is available in SFP cage 4
e = What is available in SFP cage 5
f = What is available in SFP cage 6
g = What is available in SFP cage 7
h = What is available in SFP cage 8
i = What is available in Slot 1
j = What is available in Slot 2
k = What is available in Slot 3
l = SATA1
m = SATA2

For the Slots (c..j):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'H' is SATA

Serdes1 protocol (n):
n = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (o):
o = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

BIN   Core/Platform/DDR
Bin1: 2000MHz/800MHz/2133MT/s

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 133.33MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock: 100MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
PBL_p_q_r_s_t.bin

p = SerDes1 Protocol
q = SerDes2 Protocol
r = Core frequency
s = Platform frequency
t = DDR frequency

For example,
	PBL_0x4b_0x51_2000_800_2133.bin

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009102:
	Default SERDES setting may cause excess errors in SATA controller
	Workaround: Write 0x502880 to LNmSSCR1 register for every lane
		before enabling SATA operation.Using PBI commands
		write 0x802880 to 0x01eb099c
		write 0x802880 to 0x01eb09dc

A-010554:
	SATA controller may fail to detect some hard drives
	Workaround: Before enabling SATA controller
		write 0x80104e20 to 0x1eb1300
		write 0x80104e20 to 0x1eb1310

A-000009:
	SATA Gen3 speed (6Gbps) exhibit high error rate
	Workaround: Before enabling SATA controller
		write 0x00502880 to 0x1eb099c
		write 0x00502880 to 0x1eb09dc
A-008851:
	Invalid transmitter/receiver preset values are used in Gen3 equalization
	phases during link training for RC mode
	This errata is valid only for PCI gen3.
	Workaround:
		write 0x00000001 to MISC_CONTROL_1_OFF
		write 0x4747 to Lane Equalization Control register for each lane
	For 0x2a_0x3f:
		write 0x00000001 to 0x036008bc
		write 0x47474747 to 0x03600164
		write 0x47474747 to 0x03600168
		write 0x00000001 to 0x037008bc
		write 0x47474747 to 0x03700154
		write 0x47474747 to 0x03700158
		write 0x00800401 to 0x03600890
		write 0x00800401 to 0x03700890
A-010477:
	PCI Express Gen3 link training equalization fails with default
	controller configuration.
	Workaround: Write the value of 0x0080_0401 to the GEN3 Control Register
	(GEN3_RELATED_OFF) located at each PCI Express controllerâ€™s
	configuration space offset 0x890 during the pre-boot initialization
	(PBI) stage.Using PBI commands
		write addr 0x03500890 data 0x00800401
		write addr 0x03600890 data 0x00800401
		write addr 0x03700890 data 0x00800401
