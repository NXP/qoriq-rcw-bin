The RCW directories names for the LS2088ARDB  boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abcdefgh_ij_kl_mn:

a = What is available in SFP cage 1
b = What is available in SFP cage 2
c = What is available in SFP cage 3
d = What is available in SFP cage 4
e = What is available in SFP cage 5
f = What is available in SFP cage 6
g = What is available in SFP cage 7
h = What is available in SFP cage 8
i = What is available in Slot 1
j = What is available in Slot 2
k = SATA1
l = SATA2

For the Slots (c..j):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'H' is SATA

Serdes1 protocol (m):
m = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (n):
n = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

BIN   Core/Platform/DDR
Bin1: 1800MHz/700MHz/1866MT/s

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 100MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock:133.33MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
PBL_o_p_q_r_s_t.bin

o = SerDes1 Protocol
p = SerDes2 Protocol
q = Core frequency
r = Platform frequency
s = DDR frequency
t = DDR3 frequency

For example,
	PBL_0x2a_0x41_1800_700_1866_1600.bin

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-010679:
	RCW[7] must be set to 1 to enable SYS_PLL_FB
	(Only required for Rev1.0)

A-009102:
	Default SERDES setting may cause excess errors in SATA controller
	Workaround: Write 0x502880 to LNmSSCR1 register for every lane
		before enabling SATA operation.Using PBI commands
		write 0x802880 to 0x01eb099c
		write 0x802880 to 0x01eb09dc

A-010554:
	SATA controller may fail to detect some hard drives
	Workaround: Before enabling SATA controller
		write 0x80104e20 to 0x1eb1300
		write 0x80104e20 to 0x1eb1310

A-000009:
	SATA Gen3 speed (6Gbps) exhibit high error rate
	Workaround: Before enabling SATA controller
		write 0x00502880 to 0x1eb099c
		write 0x00502880 to 0x1eb09dc
