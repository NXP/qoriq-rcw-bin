The RCW directories names for the LS2080ARDB boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abcdefgh_ij_kl_mn:

a = What is available in SFP cage 1
b = What is available in SFP cage 2
c = What is available in SFP cage 3
d = What is available in SFP cage 4
e = What is available in SFP cage 5
f = What is available in SFP cage 6
g = What is available in SFP cage 7
h = What is available in SFP cage 8
i = What is available in Slot 1
j = What is available in Slot 2
k = SATA1
l = SATA2

For the Slots (c..j):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'H' is SATA

Serdes1 protocol (m):
m = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (n):
n = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

BIN   Core/Platform/DDR
Bin1: 1867MHz/533MHz/1867MT/s


Files naming convention
=============================
PBL_o_p_x_y_z.bin

o = SerDes1 Protocol
p = SerDes2 Protocol
x = Core frequency
y = Platform frequency
z = DDR frequency

For example,
	PBL_0x2a_0x07_1867_533_1867.bin
