abcdef_g_h_i (default RRX_PPP_95) nomenclature means:
a = 'R'  indicates RGMII1 @ DTSEC3 is supported
b = 'R'  indicates RGMII2 @ DTSEC4 is supported
c = 'X'  indicates 10G Base-T is supported
d = 'P'  indicates PCIe3 in the PCIe slot
e = 'P'  indicates PCIe2 in the mini-PCI
f = 'P'  indicates PCIe1 in the mini-PCI
g = '95' indicates SerDes protocol 0x95
